# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's game of life is a cellular automata simulation that follows simple rules to create interesting patterns. Rules: Living cells with two or three neighbors stay alive in the next step of the simulation; Dead cells with exactly three neighbors become alive in the next step of the simulation; Any other cell dies or stays dead in the next step of the simulation.
