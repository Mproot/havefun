# Collatz Sequence
The collatz sequence, also called the 3n + 1 problem, is the simplest impossible math problem. From a starting number n, follow three rules to get the next number in the sequence. It is generally thought, but so far not mathematically proven, that every starting number eventually terminates at 1.
